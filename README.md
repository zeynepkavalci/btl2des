# btl2des
Lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of carboxylic ester bonds of lipids. This enzyme can catalyze a wide range of reactions with only a single active site, indicating its catalytic complexity.

Deep eutectic solvent (DES) is non-toxic, non-volatile, non-flammable, inexpensive, biodegradable, and easy to prepare, unlike organic solvents. It has been effectively used for lipase-catalyzed reactions. Production of pharmaceuticals, biofuels and agrochemicals are examples of lipase applications. DES can be prepared by mixing a hydrogen bond acceptor and a hydrogen bond donor. They form a hydrogen bond network and with this, it stays as liquid. DES is very important as it can be used as a solvent, substrate and both solvent and substrate in an enzymatic reaction. DESs are very viscous, and enzymes need flexibility to work. 

Two types of DES (glyceline and ethaline) are compared while having the same concentration ratios. With this, how different types of DES at the same concentration would affect the stability of lipase and how the solvent structure would change were checked using computational methods. The systems were prepared, open structure lipase was dissolved in glycerol, glyceline and ethaline. 

Thermoalkalophilic lipases show promise in DES-based industrial reactions. Findings of this study provided novel insights into the optimal lipase stability in DESs by tailoring physiochemical properties as well as composition of the solvent.
